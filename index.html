                this webpage is about ninjas... and robots. specifically it's about ninja-robots! there is a lot of benefit to being a <span id="topic-span">ninja-robot.</span> <br/>
                i'm going to list them for you:
                </p>
                <ul id="first-list">
                    <li>you know ninjitsu</li>
                    <li>you're made of metal, so you're tough</li>
                    <li>you're sneaky even though you're made of metal</li>
                    <li>if your robot-arm falls off, you're trained in using it as a weapon</li>
                    <li>hopefully your arm won't fall off since you're a properly made robot!</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="second-content">
                    uh oh, it looks like some mean prankster has somehow teleported into the html file and made some changes. instead of being about ninja-robots, they've made it about <span class="sam-uni">samurai-unicorns</span>!<hr/>
                <div id="call-to-arms">
                    <h3 id="challenge-heading">a new challenger!</h3>
                    <span class="hack-call">hack-0-tron</span>: brave html/js ninja, do you have what it takes to rise to my challenge?

                    <span class="ninja-call">ninja-spirit:</span> brave html/js warrior, please help! the dreaded <span class="hack-call">hack-0-tron</span> seems to have found a way to interfere with our html transmission! <br/>
                    do you have what it takes to save our page? <br/>
                    it seems that he's changed all references to our ninja-robot squad to be about the dreaded samurai-unicorn army! <br/>
                    i'm powerless to help since i'm trapped in the html file! <br/>
                    i know you have the <span id="js-training">javascript training</span> to right this wrong!<br/><br/>
                    please fix the html elements in the next section... please!
