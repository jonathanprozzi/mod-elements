                we're a pretty close-knit group of friends who've undergone a special type of ninjitsu training that incorporates the power of robotics! <br/>
                don't be fooled into thinking that we've only recently emerged. we're an ancient type of robot... <br/>
                we may be able to <span id="time-travel">travel in time & space... </span><br/>
                in fact, here's a quote from someone about how awesome we are:
                <blockquote id="adam-one">
                    "ninja-robots are totally awesome and have been around <em> forever
                    </em>" - <cite>adam b.</cite>
