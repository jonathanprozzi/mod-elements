                i'm going to list them for you:
                </p>

                    <li>you know ninjitsu</li>
                    <li>you're made of metal, so you're tough</li>
                    <li>you're sneaky even though you're made of metal</li>
                    <li>if your robot-arm falls off, you're trained in using it as a weapon</li>
                    <li>hopefully your arm won't fall off since you're a properly made robot!</li>

                    uh oh, it looks like some mean prankster has somehow teleported into the html file and made some changes.<br/>
                    instead of being about ninja-robots, they've made it about </span><span class="sam-uni">samurai-unicorns</span>!<hr/>
