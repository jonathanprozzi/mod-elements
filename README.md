# mod-elements
Fun little activity full of html elements (with ids and classes) to be changed with JavaScript. This is an activity for practicing modifying, creating, and removing html elements with JavaScript.

## activity (notes from the js file)
/* ****             READ ME!!               ****

    welcome to the javascript file for the modifying/adding/removing elements lesson! there is lots of html in the index.html file but don't fret! you don't need to worry about a lot of it.
        this activity is intended to be a (hopefully!) fun way to practice working with     html elements and dom selection techniques.
        primarily you'll be using .getElementById('id-name') such as this:

        var myVar = document.getElementById('id-name'); and then you'll use javascript to modify and change whichever element you're targeting.

        you can also do:
            document.body.removeChild(myVar) and document.body.appendChild(myVar)
                these remove and add targeted elements

    throughout this file there will be some tips to guide you along the way.

    remember: this is super important! please don't remove things from the index.html file! this activity is specifically for modifying elements -with- javascript!

    you can delete these comments after reading. (unless you really like them!)
