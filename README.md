# mod-elements
Fun little activity full of html elements (with ids and classes) to be changed with JavaScript. This is an activity for practicing modifying, creating, and removing html elements with JavaScript.

You can check out the page here: https://jonathanprozzi.github.io/mod-elements/

## Activity (notes from the js file)
There is a lot of elements here that are marked up with lots of id properties. There are some directions in the HTML itself as well as in the JavaScript file. 

* Do your best to follow the instructions and remove / modify / add the necessary elements. 
* Have fun with this activity! The point is to build confidence working with the id property in HTML elements and how to use .getElementById() to target them.

Remember: This is super important! Please don't remove things from the index.html file! This activity is specifically for modifying elements -with- JavaScript!


Here is a copy of the comments from the JS file for reference:

/* ****             READ ME!!               ****

    welcome to the javascript file for the modifying/adding/removing elements lesson! there is lots of html in the index.html file but don't fret! you don't need to worry about a lot of it.
        this activity is intended to be a (hopefully!) fun way to practice working with     html elements and dom selection techniques.
        primarily you'll be using .getElementById('id-name') such as this:

        var myVar = document.getElementById('id-name'); and then you'll use javascript to modify and change whichever element you're targetting.

        you can also do:
            document.body.removeChild(myVar) and document.body.appendChild(myVar)
                these remove and add targetted elements

    throughout this file there will be some tips to guide you along the way.

    remember: this is super important! please don't remove things from the index.html file! this activity is specifically for modifying elements -with- javascript!

    you can delete these comments after reading. (nless you really like them!)
